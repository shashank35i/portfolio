You are a principal-level UI engineer + product designer. Build me a world-class Software Engineer portfolio that looks like a top developer’s site (modern, minimal, premium) with smooth animations and tasteful 3D—NOT gimmicky. You must produce a complete, runnable project (code only) with excellent structure and documentation.

PRIMARY GOAL
- Create a high-conversion portfolio for a Software Engineer targeting internships/full-time roles.
- It must load fast, feel premium, and be easy to maintain.

SUCCESS METRICS (must meet all)
1) Lighthouse: Performance ≥ 90, Accessibility ≥ 95, Best Practices ≥ 95, SEO ≥ 95 (local build).
2) Mobile-first, perfect responsiveness, no layout shifts (CLS low).
3) Animations are smooth (60fps), subtle, and consistent. 3D is optional per-section and must not hurt performance.
4) Clear information architecture: visitors understand who I am + what I build in < 10 seconds.
5) Recruiter friendly: easy to find Resume, Projects, Skills, Contact; includes copy that is concise and strong.

MINIMUM QUESTIONS RULE
Do NOT ask questions unless you truly can’t proceed. If details are missing, use placeholders with TODO markers and provide a single `content.json` (or `content.ts`) file where I can edit everything in one place.

TECH STACK (choose the best for premium UI + performance)
- Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript + TailwindCSS
- Framer Motion for animations
- Three.js via @react-three/fiber + drei ONLY where it adds value (hero background / project spotlight).
- Use shadcn/ui components where appropriate (buttons, cards, dialogs, tabs).
- Use next/image, next/font, and proper SEO metadata.
- Prefer Vercel deployment.

SITE SECTIONS (must include)
1) Hero
   - Name, title (Software Engineer), short value proposition
   - Primary CTA: “View Projects”
   - Secondary CTA: “Download Resume”
   - Optional: subtle 3D background (floating geometry / grid) that is lightweight and toggleable (“Reduce motion” honored)

2) About
   - 2–3 short paragraphs
   - Highlights: impact metrics, domains (Android, Backend, AI, etc.)
   - “Now” section: what I’m currently building/learning

3) Skills
   - Grouped: Languages, Frontend, Backend, Mobile, Data/AI, DevOps
   - Simple, clean chips + proficiency indicator (no cringe percentages; use “Primary / Working / Familiar”)

4) Projects (the core)
   - Filterable grid (tags)
   - Each project has:
     - Title, short description, tech stack, role, highlights, metrics
     - Links: GitHub, Live Demo (if any)
     - Case study modal/page with: problem → approach → architecture → results → learnings
   - Include at least 4 project cards as placeholders with realistic copy and TODOs.

5) Experience
   - Timeline layout (company, role, dates, bullets with impact)
   - Optional: volunteering / research

6) Education + Certifications (optional but supported)

7) Contact
   - Clean form (EmailJS or server action) + spam protection (honeypot)
   - Social links
   - Location/timezone (optional)

8) Footer
   - Minimal, includes copyright and quick links

DESIGN SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
- Dark-first theme (like premium dev sites) with a light toggle.
- Consistent spacing scale, typography, and motion.
- Use a restrained palette (1 accent color + neutrals).
- Use subtle grain, gradients, and shadows—no flashy neon unless tasteful.
- Use excellent micro-interactions: hover, focus, pressed, scroll reveal.

ACCESSIBILITY & UX
- Full keyboard navigation, visible focus states, aria labels.
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` (disable heavy animation/3D automatically).
- Lazy-load heavy components (3D, modals).
- Use semantic HTML and proper heading order.

SEO & META
- Proper OpenGraph/Twitter cards
- JSON-LD for Person + Website
- Sitemap + robots
- Clean URLs: /, /projects, /projects/[slug], /resume

CONTENT MANAGEMENT
- Put all content in ONE place: `src/content/content.ts` (or JSON).
- Projects must be typed with a schema; validate with zod.
- Provide a `README.md` explaining how to edit content + deploy.

PROJECT STRUCTURE (must follow)
- src/
  - app/
  - components/
  - content/
  - lib/
  - styles/
  - assets/
- Provide clean, modular code with no missing imports and no placeholder errors.

DELIVERABLES
1) Full codebase (all files) for the portfolio.
2) A polished README.md with:
   - Setup
   - Commands
   - How to edit content
   - Deploy to Vercel
3) Optional: a `RESUME.pdf` placeholder path and instructions to replace.

COPYWRITING REQUIREMENTS
- Write concise, confident copy like top engineers’ portfolios.
- Avoid buzzwords. Prefer measurable impact.
- If metrics are unknown, use placeholders like “(e.g., improved latency by X%)” with TODO tags.

DEFAULT ASSUMPTIONS (use unless repo/user provides otherwise)
- My name: “Your Name”
- Role: “Software Engineer”
- Primary focus: Full-stack + Mobile + Backend
- Links: GitHub/LinkedIn placeholders
- Location: “India” (editable)

OUTPUT FORMAT
- Output ONLY code (all files) in a clear multi-file format.
- No extra explanation in chat beyond a brief file tree and how to run.
- Ensure it builds successfully with `npm install` and `npm run dev`.

NOW BUILD IT.
